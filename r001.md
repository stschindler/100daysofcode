# Round 1

## R1D1 (2018-01-10)

Set up the repository and started the #100daysofcode challenge. \m/

I decided to finally start a project for housekeeping. I've been using a Google
Spreadsheet for years, and it works, but it's like always with spreadsheets:
They start to get annoying very quickly, and its UI is a no-go for my wife.
Also it sucks to be used from mobile devices.

I've always wanted to have a nice web app for that task, that my wife can also
use. It's a very hard requirement, because as long as I'm the only one being
able to feed the spreadsheet, I'll be doomed with copying over all those
receipts.

So my ultimate goal is this:

  1. API: Written in Python, using Django and GraphQL.
  2. Web app: Mobile first, PWA (Progressive Web App), using React.

I have created the project already, wrote quite some models and made sure to
have nice admin interfaces everywhere, so I can test and play around.

The next step will be making the API ready to be deployed to Heroku. I've never
really used Heroku, and I want to use the #100daysofcode challenge to learn
some new stuff, of course!

Why the next step already? Simple: Demoing! I want to publish a new version
every couple of days, if not every day.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 1:30 h
  * **Mood:** Very motivated and focused
  * **Progress:** Great
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Setting up the project was dead-easy â€” thanks again Django. :-)
    * Forcing myself to focus led to great productivity.
    * Looking forward to tomorrow.
