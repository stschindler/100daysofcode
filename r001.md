### R1D13 (2018-01-31)

Today I continued working on the mailing, as well as login mutation. I started
with the login thingy but soon realized that I still have the mail task open.

Sending out mails works now. The whole mail template, signature and fragment
stuff came all together nicely. It's really great to see tailoring a nice
solution pay off. :-)

The activation mail is still missing two things, though: The activation URL and
the opt-out link + mechanism. Sounds like a good plan for tomorrow. :-)

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 2:02 h
  * **Mood:** Happy.
  * **Progress:** Great progress, all pieces came together nicely.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * For me it always helps having a clear idea of the big picture before
      starting to program on modules.
    * The e-mailing ideas fit perfectly fine.
    * Python PyPI is absolutely great. Without effort, I was able to provide
      plain text e-mail bodies next to the HTML part, for users who don't like
      HTML. I use html2text which does the conversion.


### R1D12 (2018-01-29)

More demo data and small adjustments today. I finished the mailing app which is
responsible for sending out mails (surprise, surprise!), but in a neat way
where administrators can easily adjust the mail content in Django's admin
panel.

One can choose from mail templates which can be written separately for
different languages. For each language, you can also store a signature. Both
e-mail and signature contents can include variables that get replaced by mail
fragments, for example web links or legal notices (very much required in
Germany!).

The last step is storing demo data for the journal, the centerpiece of
MoneyJoe. It's almost complete, but not committed yet.

After that I'll be concentrating on implementing all required API endpoints. I
guess starting work on the frontend part isn't too far away. :-)

Oh by the way, I really should do unit testing on the API endpoints. My biggest
concern with web APIs is security: Users shall only see what they are intended
to see. This has to be guaranteed by all costs.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 2:08 h
  * **Mood:** Pleased.
  * **Progress:** Again steady progress, speed is perfectly fine.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * The way I pump demo data into the app can be applied to all models. The
      little helper functions I wrote totally pay off, mostly resulting in
      better code readability.

### R1D11 (2018-01-26)

Hadn't too much time today, but was at least able to continue on the demo data.
That one will be finished soon!

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 0:30 h
  * **Mood:** Neutral
  * **Progress:** Not much progress, but steady.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Nothing special to report today. :-)

### R1D10 (2018-01-25)

More work on the data models. Not much I can say about that, but I'm really
trying to make this a nice one.

MoneyJoe will be able to work with multiple currencies within single accounts,
so I'm already counting that in when designing all the models. It definitely
helps to have quite some experience in that field, thus having a good amount
of foresight.

I really love building backend stuff!

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 1:06 h
  * **Mood:** Excited
  * **Progress:** Progress is constant -- constantly good!
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * I love backend stuff.

### R1D9 (2018-01-24)

Today I continued working on the data model, namely mail and geo models. I've
also created a Django command for loading some default mail templates.

Installing/setting up something without nice defaults is very annoying, and so
many products do that. :-( Not MoneyJoe!

I'm not 100 % satisfied with the models yet, so I will continue working on them
the next day.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 0:33 h
  * **Mood:** Neutral
  * **Progress:** Not much time, but good progress.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Working with Django for modelling the database is so easy and fun. It's
      indeed my favorite ORM.

### R1D8 (2018-01-23)

Ended the fight with Graphene. The Relay problem I talked about the last time
could be solved by writing a tiny Python decorator function. Sometimes it
almost hurts that you freak out about issues in 3rd party products that you can
simply solve yourself in a couple of minutes.

Sometimes I wish I was a beginner again. Simply because beginners tend to do
everything themselves. ;-)

Alright, so I'm quite happy with the GraphQL interface now. I went ahead and
implemented registering accounts as the first GraphQL mutation. Works quite
well and was really fast to do — I admit, thanks to Graphene. ;-)

The next step is properly sending out an activation e-mail, do the opt-in and
provide a one click out-out URL. We don't want to annoy the users, do we?

Oh by the way, I registered moneyjoe.io.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 2:34 h
  * **Mood:** Happy and motivated
  * **Progress:** Very good progress, didn't have to face lots of problems.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Sometimes building some workarounds or extensions yourself can solve the
      the biggest hurdles.
    * Registering domains is fun.

### R1D7 (2018-01-19)

I'm still fighting with Graphene. I have to admit that its documentation is
lacking a lot of information. The very basic things work quickly, but then you
are very much on your own. There seem to be much more JS GraphQL developers
than Python ones, because I'm having hard times finding help and resources on
the web.

For example, Graphene has no way of setting a maximum or default page size for
lists that are published through the API. That really makes me wonder whether
Graphene has ever, without serious patches, hit a production system?

Graphene has support for Relay, a protocol that adds global IDs (they contain
both the data type and ID), pagination etc. All the nifty stuff that made
working with Graphene real fun, like automatic resolving data from Python
objects, doesn't work with the Relay stuff.

So either I haven't understood the codebase good enough yet, or Graphene indeed
needs more work. If that's the case, I have to question using GraphQL for this
project. There's no other GraphQL framework for Python, and I'm not planning to
write one myself.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 1:13 h
  * **Mood:** Frustrated and bugged
  * **Progress:** Today's session felt like a pure waste of time.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Framework and libraries are great. But they also mean more dependencies.
    * If dependencies don't have what you need, you will have to invest time
      and effort into making things work.
    * If dependencies don't have strong communities, you might experience real
      dealbreakers. -sigh-

### R1D6 (2018-01-18)

I hadn't have too much time today for hacking on the project. Although I was
still able to finish the decorator that limits the result set length. No more
DDoS'ing of my API is possible. ;-)

To be honest, there's still the problem that the API can be theoretically
hugely overloaded by requesting lots of embedded data. But I consider that an
optimization for a later point in time.

It's time to build the API!

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 0:56 h
  * **Mood:** Neutral
  * **Progress:** Finished an important utility for future work.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Python is an awesome language :-)

### R1D5 (2018-01-17)

Today was mostly spent on research. I studied Graphene's and GraphQL-Python's
source code a bit to understand how their Relay pagination and cursor
implementations work. You know, when magic things happen automagically it's
nice, but also often a bit confusing if you want to understand what the heck is
going on under the hood. ;-)

Next task will be setting sensitive defaults for maximum page sizes and similar
things.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 0:36 h
  * **Mood:** Very interested and curious
  * **Progress:** No progress on the project itself
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Concentrating on reading documentation and source code of other projects
      is fun and very rewarding.
    * Especially reading source code when documentation is lacking (I find
      Graphene's docs to be very incomplete) is a very good idea.

### R1D4 (2018-01-16)

I finished the Docker Compose file for development today. The development stack
contains a Postgres database and the Django development server.

I chose to include all packages from the _requirements.txt_ file in the API
Docker image. Research showed that lots of people do actually run `pip install`
manually by exec'ing into the container.  I'm unsure about what's better; but
for sure both variants work. :-)

Given that creating the Docker Compose file was so easy (I started by copying
the production stack config file), I've started with the GraphQL API code. But
I soon recognized that I have to do some more research on _best practices_
(which is kind of funny given GraphQL's young age).

The Git repository contains some code already, but it's for sure going to be
replaced by something better.

Oh, and I totally became lost in hacking, so instead of 1 hour, I spent a total
of 3:20 h. :O

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 3:20 h
  * **Mood:** Happy (Compose), overwhelmed (GraphQL), curious (research)
  * **Progress:** I stick with the plan — and was even able to begin with the
    API code
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Docker Compose was super easy.
    * Developing with Compose is really great; dependencies are installed and
      set up in no time. This will drastically pay off when more services are
      incorporated.
    * It's great to dedicate hacking time into areas which you aren't very
      experienced in. It's exactly what I enjoyed so much before becoming a
      professional developer.

### R1D3 (2018-01-15)

Finally, I'm able to continue on my journey. Unfortunately during the last
weekend, I haven't had time that I could spend on the challenge. This might
become the usual case for weekends, as I mostly try to dedicate time to my
family.

But that's fine, as that won't hold me back from just continuing on this
beautiful Monday. ;-)

I continued working on the Docker setup and early recognized that I need some
more services besides the API/app server: A CDN webserver that serves the
Django admin static files, and a reverse proxy that routes all incoming
requests either to the app or CDN server.

Granted, I know such setups from production systems and projects already, so
this was easier for me than for beginners. But I was able to learn some stuff
in the area of Docker Stack and Docker Compose.

The stack does *not* contain a service for the database. I tend to keep these
outside of deployable stacks.

I have also setup separate Git repositories for all the sub-projects, and one
"mother" repository that holds sub-modules plus the Docker Stack config file.
Makefiles help with building all Docker images.

Tomorrow I'm going to setup a Docker Compose file solely for development, which
will then of course include a database service as well.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 2:45 h
  * **Mood:** Super motivated.
  * **Progress:** Finished what I wanted to finish — great progress.
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Albeit being a long-time and intensive Docker user, it's the first time
      I really got my hands dirty with Compose and Stack.
    * Putting together a small stack of some Nginx and Gunicorn services was
      very easy and straightforward.

### R1D2 (2018-01-11)

I published the source code repository at
[GitHub](https://github.com/stschindler/money_joe-api). I checked (again) OSS
licenses and chose the AGPL for maximum _enforced_ freedom. ;-)

As announced yesterday, I started setting up my project — which I call
_MoneyJoe_ — for Heroku. Without success. Heroku wasn't cool with me putting my
sources under _src_. Feeling that kind of restrictions (and not being in the
mood of looking for workarounds/fixes), I quickly chose to drop Heroku.

Instead I'm focussing more on what I already know much better: Docker. I
haven't really made use of Compose and Stacks yet, so that's why I'm targeting
as my learning exercise.

The Docker images are built on Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution.
I'm using a multi-stage build to reduce the image size by about 50% (200 MB to
100 MB, thanks to GCC and development files needed for building the Postgres
Python extension).

I was able to finish the Dockerfile, but it's far from being complete yet. I
will have to add a compose/stack configuration file for spooling up a full
environment that allows for easy demoing — my initial goal. ;-)

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 1:00 h
  * **Mood:** Started motivated, became frustrated, ended neutral
  * **Progress:** Less than expected
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Heroku was a bad decision for me. I tried Heroku in the past and simply
      forgot about the restrictions. Avoidable!
    * Docker still is an awesome experience — I'm very glad for multi-stage
      builds.
    * Looking forward to deploying a MoneyJoe stack to the demo server.

### R1D1 (2018-01-10)

Set up the repository and started the #100daysofcode challenge. \m/

I decided to finally start a project for housekeeping. I've been using a Google
Spreadsheet for years, and it works, but it's like always with spreadsheets:
They start to get annoying very quickly, and its UI is a no-go for my wife.
Also it sucks to be used from mobile devices.

I've always wanted to have a nice web app for that task, that my wife can also
use. It's a very hard requirement, because as long as I'm the only one being
able to feed the spreadsheet, I'll be doomed with copying over all those
receipts.

So my ultimate goal is this:

  1. API: Written in Python, using Django and GraphQL.
  2. Web app: Mobile first, PWA (Progressive Web App), using React.

I have created the project already, wrote quite some models and made sure to
have nice admin interfaces everywhere, so I can test and play around.

The next step will be making the API ready to be deployed to Heroku. I've never
really used Heroku, and I want to use the #100daysofcode challenge to learn
some new stuff, of course!

Why the next step already? Simple: Demoing! I want to publish a new version
every couple of days, if not every day.

  * **Hours on the record for today:** 1:30 h
  * **Mood:** Very motivated and focused
  * **Progress:** Great
  * **Thoughts, facts, experiences:**
    * Setting up the project was dead-easy — thanks again Django. :-)
    * Forcing myself to focus led to great productivity.
    * Looking forward to tomorrow.
